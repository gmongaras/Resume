I just want to put my resume code somewhere. Maybe add some scripts to try to hack the stupid job bot system. It's also nice to have a changelog.

Compile with `pdflatex resume.tex resume.pdf`


In `script2.py` you can add a list of job applications. GPT will take those, reformat the base resume, and create an optional cover letter for each. You can let this run one day and come back to it. The outputs are in `outputs` with numbered text files to make it easy to go back and apply with each resume and cover letter.
